`@nano_kit/store` is a lightweight state management library inspired by [Nano Stores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) and built around [a push-pull based reactivity system](https://github.com/stackblitz/alien-signals).

- **Tiny**. ~2 kB (minified & brotlied). Zero dependencies.
- **Fast**. Optimized for performance using the push-pull algorithm.
- **Tree-Shakeable**. Only the methods you import end up in your bundle.
- **TypeScript**. First-class type support out of the box.

## Installation

Install the package using your favorite package manager:

<Tabs syncKey='pkg'>
  <TabItem label='pnpm' icon='pnpm'>
    <Code frame='none' lang='bash' code='pnpm add @nano_kit/store' />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='Yarn' icon='seti:yarn'>
    <Code frame='none' lang='bash' code='yarn add @nano_kit/store' />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='npm' icon='seti:npm'>
    <Code frame='none' lang='bash' code='npm install @nano_kit/store' />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Quick Start

Here is a minimal example demonstrating signals, computed values, and effects in action:

```ts
import { signal, onMount, computed, effect } from '@nano_kit/store'

/* Create independent atomic stores */
const $count = signal(1)

/* Mountable: Run logic only when store has listeners */
onMount($count, () => {
  console.log('Mounted: Store is active')
  /* e.g., open websocket, start timer, etc. */

  return () => {
    console.log('Unmounted: Store is idle')
    /* e.g., close websocket, stop timer */
  }
})

/* Derive state (computed values are lazy & cached) */
const $double = computed(() => $count() * 2)

/* React to changes (triggers onMount) */
const unsub = effect(() => {
  console.log(`Count: ${$count()}, Double: ${$double()}`)
})

/* Update triggers granular propagation */
$count(2)

/* Cleanup: removes listener and triggers onMount destructor */
unsub()
```
