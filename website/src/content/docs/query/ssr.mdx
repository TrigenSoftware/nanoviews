import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Aside type='caution'>SSR functionality is currently in **Alpha** stage. It is not fully implemented and the API may change in future releases.</Aside>

Complete documentation, hydration guides, and framework-specific examples are coming soon!

Currently, you can use the `tasks` extension to await promises on the server (as described in the [Advanced](/query/advanced#tasks) section), but full hydration support is still in development.
