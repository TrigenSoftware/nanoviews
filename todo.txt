- solid example

- bundle types
- toReadableSignal
- listener & fn -> callback?
- check arrow fns -> bind
- typed effectattrs <T>
- later: resort effects
- restore object arg for record?
- additional arg for record in for$? as$
- atIndex$ atKey$ ?
- static index for untracked loop
- predefined trackers
- serialize - start all marked stores?
- onMountEffectScope?
- when$
- child static parent
- $ - signals, $$ - blocks?
- blocks to nodes?)

- !== undefined is faster
- prop: undefined is faster
- for let i faster than array methods
- push(...arr) is slow
- noop faster than check
- getter setter are slow (not in class)
- Reflect.get is slow
- arr.length = 0 is slower than arr = []

- html + head components
- universal dom
- ssr
- hydration

- enhance events / modifiers?
- svg ?
- transitions ?

- error boundaries

- hmr
- more informative errors
